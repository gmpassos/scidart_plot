All the project status will be shared and updated in the __Projects__ section of Github.

## 🙌 How to contribute

I recommend check the __Projects__ section and choose a task or choose and solve a problem with **SciDart** and 
implement the missing parts and read the file CONTRIBUTING.md.

The reference values for all functions came from with SciPy. The contributions need use SciPy as reference too.

Every contribution need to have tests, documentation and examples, otherwise, the pull request will be blocked.
